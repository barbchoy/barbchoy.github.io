If you do not understand what is so good about CSS, why we need to have keep a seperate file that we have to keep referencing to from the HTML pages, let me try to explain with a non technical life example. 

Imagine you have multiple children. When school registration time comes along any parents with multiple children know that it means paperwork time. For each child they ask you about parents information, home address, contact information, emergency contact, your contact preferences etc. You write down the same information multiple times, and it is very annoying. Say here comes the school district coming up with a new webiste that you can enter these common information only once and apply it to all children in the family. Wouldn't you love it? This is the CSS. You can apply the same styling to multiple HTML pages, and that is sweet.
