I believe that a person will do well at her job if she loves it. If people love what they do, they will do them well.  I thought if I choose something that I am interested in I will be more excited about the project and more likely be succesful. I am a big lover for classical music and as a resident in the SF Bay Area I decided to scrape the website of the San Francisco  Symphony. 

From the start, I wanted to keep my project clean and simple. The first interface asks user about the month of concert season, from July 18 - Sept 19. Then the program finds the corresponding page for the month, and scrapes out the concert basic information of title and dates. In the second level the program asks the users if he wants more details of a particular concert. It then further scrapes out deeper information about the concert like conductor, performers, program and descripsiton. All these information are stored as attributes of the class variables @concerts. I hope this gives you an overview of my simple CLI project.
