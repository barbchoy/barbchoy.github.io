I am very excited to about working on my Rails project because it feels like a real-world application, well, sort of. I am creating a "light" version of the Airbnb. Of course it is a very reduced version of the real Airbnb. The most important thing that I have learnt is when you are not sure, just try it out and see what happens. If it doesn't then you know you have to do something else. If you don't know where to start, try searching it up online. Very often I found answers to the problems that I have from StackOverflow or other resources. In many cases people had that same problem before, and the answers are probably readily available somwhere. You just have to look for it. Also by researching into a problem, you learn much deeper about it.
