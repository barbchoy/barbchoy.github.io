Many people are writers nowadays. I am creating a platform where writers can publish their works without a publisher, anytime, and for free. Just like other social media platforms that we are all familiar with, each writer has their own unique username and password. After they log in, they can choose to browse other people's works, or create their own. Each author can only edit the work that they created, whereas they can browse other people's work. 

I am very excited to used Sinatra for my project. It provides such a convenient, easy to use framework. I can create many routes that provide different functions, all controlled by the controllers and the results are displayed by the views. The migrations make creating a database very easy. It is very dynamic. The routes and views a can be reused by all authors, however many there are. It also makes making changes very easy.  The relatively uncomplicated code is very powerful and can perform many functions, thanks to the Sinatra framework. 

There are many features that may be added to my project in the future. How about making the contents searchable? Of course we have to take care of copyrights too. For now I am excited to get it started.
