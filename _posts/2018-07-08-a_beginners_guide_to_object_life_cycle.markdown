What is an Object? It sounds like such a abstract idea, especially for beginners. In Ruby everything is an object, all classes are objects. They have properties and they have functions. Take a non-programming example for the sake of explanation. A dog is an object. A family bought a new puppy. Just like some classes that already come with Ruby, a new puppy came with some properties and functions on its own. For example, it comes with a pre-exist color, 4 legs, pointy or brushy tail, it barks, it poops etc. You get the idea. The owner can give it new properties eg. name. The owner can teach it new tricks ( called methods in Ruby or functions in some other programming languages ) eg. roll_over, stand_on_hind_legs, shake_hands. The dog gives the family a lot of joy during its life cycle. Eventually the dog will die and all the properties and functions associated will vanish. In programming, the object vanishes when the program exits or the object is destroyed.
