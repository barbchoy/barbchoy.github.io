Learning to code is just like everything else that you are doing in life. The most important thing is to practice. Atheletes practice everyday. The top ones practice even more.  Actors rehearse many times before they go up on stage. Musicians practice  hundreds of times and for years to perfect the same pieces of music throughout their lives. Theses are not skills that one can understand the theory and then will do well. It takes repetitions, muscle and brain memories to be able to perform well at the time that is needed. It takes consistency and perserverence. For professional software engineers this is what they do everyday and how experience is acquired. For us who are learning you won't go very far if you only do your exercises and labs on a good day, or on a day when everything else is done. How often do you have a day like this? Do you think Olympians practice only on their good days? Obviously not. We need to set a time, a goal, a plan and have the discipline to do it no matter what.  Some days will be more productive than others, but your brain muscles are still being trained no matter what and be more used to problem solving. Have you ever looked at your high school math again, or looked at a piece of music that you used to play when you were young, but now you feel so rusty? We don't want our brain to get rusty when we have a bigger goal of getting  job in mind. So set a goal, and time and do it everyday.
