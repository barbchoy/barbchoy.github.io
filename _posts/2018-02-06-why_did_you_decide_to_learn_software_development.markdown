Being a software engineer is fun! There is a great sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, seeing the code that you wrote doing magical things. It is where technical knowledge and creativity meet. 

The world is becoming ever more software oriented. Cars used to be mostly mechanical. Cars nowadays have many parts centrally controlled in the central console by software. eg. the navigation, temperature and climate, music and media playing, bluetooth connection to cell phone etcs. Most people have a smartphone nowadays. There is an app for everything, from banking to shopping to weight lost. You can see who is at your door at home while you are seated in the office through the web browser or smartphone. You can tell Alexa to turn off the lights if you happen to forget and feel too lazy to walk five steps to the switch. The examples are endless. New life improving innovations are coming out everyday. I see more opportunities in  software development than ever before. I see a very high and still growing demand for software development. 

I have a background in software development and I was a software engineer at the beginning of my career until my career got interrupted for family reasons. I was working in medical equipment industry and it was enjoyable. It was also meaningful knowing that my work saved lives. By updating my technical knowledge I plan to fill a software engineer vacancy in the market in the near future.
